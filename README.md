# Hotel-Booking-Analysis
The hotel industry relies on data to make informed decisions and provide a 
better guest experience. In this internship, you will work with a hotel reservation 
dataset to gain insights into guest preferences, booking trends, and other key 
factors that impact the hotel's operations. You will use SQL to query and analyze 
the data, as well as answer specific questions about the dataset.
