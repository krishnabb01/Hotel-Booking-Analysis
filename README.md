# Hotel-Booking-Analysis
The hotel industry relies on data to make informed decisions and provide a better guest experience. In this project, I work with a hotel reservation dataset to gain insights into guest preferences, booking trends, and other key factors that impact the hotel' operations. I use My SQL query and analyze the data, as well as answer specific questions about the dataset.
